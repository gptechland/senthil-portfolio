<h2>🌍 Why Maintaining ISO 27001 Matters</h2>
<p>Beyond just good security hygiene, ISO 27001 certification acts as a <strong>global benchmark</strong> for trust and credibility. It shows clients, regulators, and partners that your organization values data protection and risk governance.</p>
<p>In many industries, maintaining ISO 27001 is <strong>not optional</strong> — it’s a prerequisite for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>🏢 Participating in government contracts and public tenders</li>
  <li>📦 Onboarding as a vendor with large enterprises</li>
  <li>🌐 Establishing credibility in cybersecurity-conscious markets</li>
</ul>

<h2>🔍 What Happens During an ISO 27001 Audit?</h2>
<p>Whether it’s your <strong>Stage 1 (Readiness Audit)</strong> or <strong>Stage 2 (Certification Audit)</strong>, here’s what to expect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>✅ <strong>Document Review:</strong> Policies, SoA (Statement of Applicability), risk assessments, asset inventories</li>
  <li>✅ <strong>Process Interviews:</strong> Your IT, HR, Security, Legal, and Operations teams may be interviewed</li>
  <li>✅ <strong>Evidence Checks:</strong> Logs, screenshots, training records, incident registers</li>
