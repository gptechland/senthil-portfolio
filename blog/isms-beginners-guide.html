      <p><strong>ISO 27001</strong> and <strong>ISO 27002</strong> are foundational standards for information security management systems (ISMS). If you're new to certification or working in an organization that's just getting started, here’s a simplified breakdown to help you stay compliant and audit-ready.</p>

      <h2>🔐 What is ISO 27001?</h2>
      <p>ISO 27001 provides the framework for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving an information security management system. It focuses on risk management and operational controls.</p>

      <h2>🧩 What's ISO 27002?</h2>
      <p>ISO 27002 is a companion to 27001. It provides detailed implementation guidance for the security controls listed in Annex A of ISO 27001.</p>

      <h2>🧭 Beginner’s Checklist to Maintain Certification</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Assign Ownership:</strong> Ensure you have a designated ISMS Manager and roles assigned for asset and risk ownership.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Update Risk Assessments:</strong> Reassess risks at least annually or when major changes occur.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Review Policies:</strong> Validate that policies (InfoSec, Acceptable Use, Backup, etc.) are reviewed and approved.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Conduct Internal Audits:</strong> Schedule and document internal audits with action items tracked.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Monitor Controls:</strong> Log reviews, patch updates, training sessions — prove controls are “live.”</li>
        <li><strong>6. Track Incidents:</strong> Maintain an incident register and ensure corrective actions are logged.</li>
        <li><strong>7. Conduct Management Reviews:</strong> Leadership should meet to review KPIs, risks, and audit results.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>📝 Bonus Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep evidence in an audit-friendly format: dated PDFs, screenshots, meeting notes, etc.</li>
        <li>Document everything — if it isn’t documented, it didn’t happen (in the auditor’s eyes!)</li>
        <li>Use a dashboard to track compliance tasks and evidence status</li>
      </ul>
